unshort-url
===========

Resolve shortened links to full URLs with a bookmarklet. Demo online: [http://9p.org.ua/r](http://9p.org.ua/r). Developed using Python and [CherryPy](http://www.cherrypy.org) web framework with [Mako templates](http://www.makotemplates.org/).

This tiny project I developed back in Dec 2008 when some people got [tinyulr.com](http://tinyurl.com/) blocked. It resolves any shortened URL into a full one on a server-side, so escaping any filtration or censorship. 

Also, it has a bookmarklet wich replaces all shortlinks on an active page, and it that can be dragged into you toolbar for later use.
