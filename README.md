Resolve shortened links to full URLs with a bookmarklet. Demo online: [http://9p.org.ua/r](http://9p.org.ua/r).

Developed using Python and **[CherryPy](http://www.cherrypy.org) web framework** with **[Mako templates](http://www.makotemplates.org/)**.

Also, it has a **bookmarklet** which replaces all short links on an active page, and it that can be dragged into you toolbar for later use.

This tiny project I developed back in Dec 2008 when some people got [tinyulr.com](http://tinyurl.com/) blocked. It resolves any shortened URL into a full one on a server-side, so escaping any filtration or censorship.
